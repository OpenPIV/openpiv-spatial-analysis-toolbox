1. The major update for the Matlab 7 SP1 (R14SP1).
2. GUIDE uses new Graphics objects, called containers or panels.
3. In SPATIALBOX, the switches between panes of SPATIAL and SELECT are with two main panels
3. In TIMEBOX, 3 panels: time history, quantity and windowing
4. In SPATIALBOX, the bug of the select all is fixed by upRowY and similar things. has to be revised in future versions.
5. In SPATIALBOX and DISTRIBBOX, the units of the Reynolds stress, dissipation and others are fixed.

1. DISTRIB.M includes no_nan_mean() function, instead of Matlab's nanmean()
2. VECREAD.M reads variable column VEC and V3D files, scanning header automatically for the number of variales.
3. Rij is now done with crosscorr2d instead of crosscoef of Matlab. i think it was kind of problem with
the shifting to center. now it looks a little bit 'nicer', but maybe not 'right'.

1. Email of Hai - the bug was with spatialbox.m the way we calculate handles.dx and handles.dy was wrong, 
the du/dy was of opposite sign

June 26, 2004
"Bug" fixes due to last emails:
1. added try...catch..end structure in load_callback to give error if something is wrong with files
2. fixed svecread to read multiple columns. this function is not checked since we do not have new type of 
   stereo V3D files
3. in cil_uigetfiles.fig, the dt is implemented
4. cil_uigetfiles now reads one, or two or more files with mouse, mouse + CTRL, and mouse + SHIFT. no time-series
5. spatialbox does not scale the data with time anymore. the decision is to be made what to do with units
6. vecread and svecread read two new variables handles.xUnits and handles.velUnits that will serve us in the 'units'.
